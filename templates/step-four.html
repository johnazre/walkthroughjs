        <h2>Loops are an enclosure that let you run the same block of code however may times you specify. There are a number of different
          loops you can use, depending on the situation, but we're going to stick to "for" loops and "while" loops for now, for brevity's
          sake.
          The major topics we will hit on are:</h2><br>

        </ul><br>


        <h1>For Loop</h1>
        <h2>So, you questions should now be, what is a for-loop and what is it often used for? In my experience, a for loop is often used
        for iterating through an array and doing something with it the contents of said array. We will hit arrays next, though, so let's
        demonstrate the point of what it does and when you see arrays next, we will cover it there.</h2>

        <h2>Not sure just what happened there? Let's walk through it. We stated that it was going to be a for loop first. After that,
        within the parentheses, we declared a variable called "i", set it to equal zero, then put a semi-colon. That variable declaration
        is telling the loop where to start. After the first semi-colon, we have "i < 6". We are saying do whatever is in the loop while "i"
        is still less than 6, as soon as it becomes 6, stop the loop. After the second semi-colon, you see "i++". That is shorthand for
        "i = i + 1". That last part says after every time the loop finished running, add 1 to i.</h2>
        <h2>Within the loop, all it says is to console.log the variable "i" every time it runs.</h2>

              //Make a for-loop using the example above. Standard practice is to use the variable "i" as the counter. If you ever wonder why that is, it stands for "index". It is commonly used in sub-text in math, as well. Let's assign "i" to start at 1 and end at 6, while using console.log (i) in the middle.<br><br>

              //Make a while-loop with variable 'i' starting at 1, log the same numbers into the browser's console as we did before.<br>
              //Remember that you MUST declare the index variable before the loop and increment it inside of the loop, otherwise you will go into an inifinite loop and crash your browser. If that happens, don't worry. Just close and reopen your browser and it should work fine.<br><br>
