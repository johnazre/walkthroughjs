        <h2>If you are just starting out, you are probably asking yourself, "What in the world could 'primitive' mean, when it comes to
        a data type?" That's a great question. The simple answer is that they are data types that cannot be broken down into anything smaller.
        Depending on who you talk to, they might describe it with different words like "basic" or "built-in", but it all basically means the same
        thing. As of right now, there are 7 primitive data types in Javascript. Luckily for you, we will only talk about three in this step.
        The rest of them we will revisit in later steps. The ones that we will focus on today are:</h2><br>
        <ul class="text-center">
          <li>
            <h3>Numbers</h3>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Strings</h3>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Boolean values</h3>
          </li>
        </ul><br>
        <h2>Numbers are any plain values with no single or double quotes surrounding them, such as 1, 2, 3, 232547635, etc.
        Strings are any ASCII character (with a few exceptions) that is surrounded by single or double quotes. The rule is that you can't use single-quotes within single-quotes and double-quotes within double-quotes, but you can use single-quotes within double-quotes and visa versa. Booleans values are either "true" or "false", but they aren't put within quotes. They are built into Javascript. It's hard to describe why they're useful until you see them in action, but trust me when I say they are.</h2>

        Ahhh, the world "variable". Reminds you of that amazing time you had all the way through math after algebra started. It's the same type of thing, but you can store more than one primitive data type in it. In fact, you can store everything we're going to talk about in a variable and it's super useful to learn because of how versatile using them can be. Right now, though, let's start with the basics.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        var x = 2; <br>
        var y = "Hello";<br>
        var z = true;
      </h2>
      <h2>
        There are a few rules that you are going to have to play by from the beginning. When you "declare" a variable for the first time, you will put "var" before it, the name of the variable, the assignment operator "=", then the value of the variable, followed by a semi-colon. If you have seen other programming languages, you might have seen other things like "int", "float", "bool", or something similar, in the place of "var". That is the beautiful part of Javascript, though. All you need to write next to the variable is "var". In some other lanugages, you have to declare the type of value that the variable will contain. Javascript knows what kind of value
        you are assigning. Javascript is awesome like that.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        So now that you know how to declare variables, it's your turn to practice!
      </h2><br>

                //Remember that your have to wrap strings in single or double quotes. If you don't, the browser will think it is a variable and throw and error. <br>

                //Make a variable called javascriptIsAwesome and assign a true or false value. <br>
                //Remember that true and false are hard coded into Javascript, so no quotes are used. If you use them, it will PROBABLY throw an error because it's not the correct type of value. Note: I say "probably" because it depends on how the comparison was written on the back-side. You will see what I mean in the next step. <br>
                var <input type="text" ng-model='var_ex3_var'> = <input type="text" ng-model="var_ex3_val">; <p ng-show="correctStuff.var_ex3" style='color: green;'> Correct </p> <br><br><br>
