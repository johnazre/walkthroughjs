        <h1>Overview of an array</h1>
        <h2>Like we said before, an array is simply a list of values, separated by commas, and surrounded by square brackets. Your question
        should now be, though, how do I access a value in said array? AHA! Let's find out with the example below:</h2>

            <div class="code-block">
            <code>
              //Empty arrays are useful for a place to put values. You can declare them empty with no issues.<br>
              var emptyArray = []; <br><br>
              //You don't have to declare an array any differently than anything other value on the left side.<br>
              var arrayWithValues = [1, 2, 3, 4];<br><br>
              //Arrays can have any type of value in it, even mixed values!<br>
              var mixedArray = [1, "2", 3, function four { console.log('4')}];<br><br>
              //We can access a value in the array by using: nameOfTheArray[index]<br><br>
              //REMEMBER!!! Arrays are zero-indexed, so if you want the first value in the array, use index zero!
              Let's use the arrayWithValues array to pull a couple values. <br>
              arrayWithValues[1]; //Will pull the second value, 2.
              arrayWithValues[2]; //Will pull the third value, 3.

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <h2>Arrays are absolutely fundamental to learning Javascript. Knowing how to search and manipulate arrays is one of the
      most useful skill you can learn, other than manipulating objects, which we're going to learn about next.</h2>
